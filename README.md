# Md. Nadim-ul-Haque | Personal Portfolio

Hey there! Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website.

I built this site to have a central place to showcase my work as a final-year CSE student. My main focus right now is **Deep Learning** and **Data Analysis**, so I designed the site to reflect that—clean, slightly tech-heavy (check out the terminal!), and focused on research.

## What's Cool About This Site?

I didn't want a generic template, so I built this from scratch using vanilla web technologies. Here are the fun parts:

* **Interactive Terminal:** There is a CLI on the home screen. You can actually type commands like `help`, `skills`, or `about` to interact with the site. It gives off that "developer" vibe I love.
* **Neural Network Background:** I used `particles.js` to create a floating node network in the background. It represents my interest in Graph Theory and Neural Networks.
* **Dark/Light Mode:** Because every developer needs a dark mode to save their eyes.
* **No Heavy Frameworks:** It's pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Fast and lightweight.

## Research & Key Projects

This portfolio highlights my shift from general coding to specialized AI research:

### 1. Deepfake Detection Model
* **The Goal:** Detecting artifacts in deepfake media to fight misinformation.
* **My Work:** Proposed a custom, lightweight CNN architecture.
* **Result:** Achieved **91% accuracy** in artifact detection compared to other heavy models.

### 2. Bangla Sign Language Dataset
* **The Goal:** Creating a *trusted* and *ready-to-use* dataset for the research community.
* **My Work:** Curated and annotated a dataset of 40 distinct Bangla Sign Language words. I realized that good models start with good data, so I focused heavily on the quality here.

### 3. Archive Projects
Older projects from my university coursework (Java, MySQL, MongoDB) are also listed in the "Archive" section to show where I started.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
* **Libraries:**
    * `particles.js` (for the background effect)
    * `EmailJS` (for the contact form—no backend server needed!)
    * `FontAwesome` (icons)
* **Design:** Custom CSS with CSS Variables for theming.

## How to Run Locally

If you want to poke around the code or use it as inspiration:

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/dewannadim007-create/portfolio.git](https://github.com/dewannadim007-create/portfolio.git)
    ```
2.  **Open it:**
    Just double-click `index.html` in your browser. No `npm install` or servers required!

## Contact Me

I'm always open to discussing Deep Learning, research collaborations, or just tech in general.
